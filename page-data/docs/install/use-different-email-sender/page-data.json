Feel free to pick any other mail service that suit you best.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a Mailjet account. the free plan should be largely enough to cover your needs.</li>\n<li>Log in with your newly created account</li>\n<li>Mailjet guides to get you started are quite good, following them should be easy enough.\nKeep in mind that from Mailjet perspective, you are a developer.</li>\n<li>The Getting started guide will ask you about the \"Send method\" to send your emails. Select <code class=\"language-text\">SMTP Relay</code></li>\n<li>Copy the credentials similarly to image below:</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"images/mailjet_credentials.png\" alt=\"Mailjet credentials screen\" />\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>SSH to the machine hosting your Jeyser installation and browse to Jeyser folder</li>\n<li>Edit <code class=\"language-text\">.env</code> file and replace <code class=\"language-text\">MAILER_URL=smtp://mailer:25</code> by <code class=\"language-text\">MAILER_URL=smtp://user:password@in-v3.mailjet.com:587</code>.</li>\n<li>Execute command <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose up -d web</code> to recreate web container with new mailer value</li>\n<li>Optionally you can stop mailer container by running <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose stop mailer</code></li>\n<li>You can improve email reception rate by following other Mailjet tutorials on DKIM and DMARC but this is out of the scope of this documentation.</li>\n<li>You can test the mail setup by creating a new user account. Jeyser should not return any error and you should see the mail in your Mailjet stats.</li>\n</ol>","editPath":"install/use-different-email-sender.md","title":"Use a different email sender","previous":{"slug":"/docs/install/annexes/","title":"Help for SSH connection"},"next":{"slug":null,"title":"Install Jeyser CRM in minutes !"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
