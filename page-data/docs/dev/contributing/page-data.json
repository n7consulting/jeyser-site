However, here are some minimal rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't do it alone</strong> </p>\n<p>If you create your own module without asking before, there are large chances your pull-request will be refused. open an issue on github to discuss about it before.</p>\n<p><strong>Be general</strong></p>\n<p>Only general modules will be integrated into the core of Jeyser CRM. A module is general if it can be used by every Junior-Entreprise. Every means every, a module helping juste a subset of JE even though it's a large one won't probably be merged.</p>\n<p>If your module is not general enough, you can still develop it and plug it into your installation. We would be glad to help you on that subject. </p>\n<p>On the contrary, if you have a bright idea but can't develop it, come on <a href=\"https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github</a> and chat with us, we can certainly do something for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Develop module only if the use time on the next 2 years will be larger than your development time</strong></p>\n<p>Once you will have the power on your Information System, it's very likely everyone will want its own Jeyser module. We also had that at N7 Consulting. We defined a simple rule to validate module development : the development time should be smaller than the expected use time on the next 2 years. We think apply it for external contributions will help Jeyser.</p>\n<p><strong>Test it</strong></p>\n<p>Jeyser is not well covert by behavioural tests. We are working on it. We won't accept external contributions without 75 % code coverage of their code.</p>\n<p><strong>Not Ok with these rules ?</strong> </p>\n<p>It's up to you. If you disagree with these rules, just fork the project and work on your own. However, we don't think it's the good solution, because fragmenting the community won't make it better. And we won't provide support for your work.</p>","editPath":"dev/contributing.md","title":"Contributing","previous":{"slug":"/docs/dev/faq/","title":"FAQ"},"next":{"slug":"/docs/dev/local-development/","title":"Local development"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
